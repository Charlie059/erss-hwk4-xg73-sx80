1. The meaning of the integer in the first line of request XML is ambiguous,
So we have to assume that the content length sent by the client will be correct.
If it has problem, we can not stop reading message from client or we may read imcomplete message.

2. We check input error in the database related action, and spread out the info of error
to the response handler.

3. We must do checker and process Query both in the request handler, although it is more complicated
and may import some instability, but we need resultSet and errorMessage the same time.
